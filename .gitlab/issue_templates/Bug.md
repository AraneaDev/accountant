- The problem you are facing is **not** documented in the [troubleshooting](../../docs/troubleshooting.md) section;
- A [GitLab issue](https://gitlab.com/altek/accountant/issues) with the same or similar problem you're having, doesn't already exist in an **open** or **closed** state;

If after going through all the previous steps you still have an issue, feel free to continue.
